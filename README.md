Note : This is a forked version of PNGTuber+, credits for the core stuff goes to Kaiakairos. make sure to support them :D
If you always wanted to try the most recent version, install Godot then clone the repository to open the project files. Builds/ compiled versions will only be for main updates or bugs that needed to be patched quickly 

<h3>PNGTube-Remix!</h3>
<br>Start PNGTubing in a more interesting and alive way.</br>
<br>This software is currently in its Alpha stages. However, it is usable!</br>
<br>This version of PNGTuber+ is made for the purpose of improving the old source code (being fully remade from scratch with optimization in mind), adding new features and more.</br>
<br>Due to being remade from scratch, some features aren't 1:1 from the og source, yet. Since it is still being worked on, but expect things to be reimplemented soon!</br>

<br>The UI had been remade to be much easier to understand thanks to [LeoRson](https://github.com/LeoRson). A document will be made when the first full release is out.</br>
<br>An in-app doc will be added too, tho.. not as complex, more of a heads up!</br>
